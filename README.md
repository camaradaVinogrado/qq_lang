A local app for cards with text and images cells in a single browser page.  
I do use for making aspects-n-samples cards during languages study.  

IndexedDB, a button present to get dump. Assets storage - Github.
Such a lame stack chosen  
just coz I had a goal to complete the app in 2 hours via AI freestyle and zero code from humans.
